      <img src="Portfolio_image.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Eric">

      <p>I am a lifetime native of the Washington D.C. area, with a strong interest in technology and coding. In 2017 I graduated from the University of Mary Washington, where I majored in marketing and minored in economics. Since graduating I've entered into the association industry, having now worked at two different associations. My current position is a Digital Content Coordinator, where I manage our organizations digital products, such as our website and email communications. I'm excited to delve into web development, as I'm interested in more opportunities to be creative, independent and flexible.</p>
      <p>
          I'm an avid sports fan who mostly watches football and baseball, and will root especially for all of the Washington D.C. teams. Aside from sports I enjoy playing any and all different types video games and watching movies. I also enjoy playing the classical guitar, even though I'm still very much a beginner.
